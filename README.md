# Data Science Insights 2019

Prepare, analyze and visualize data to compare different aspects of how people might take on Data Science tasks/learning. Also, there is a comparison in terms of online courses that people tend to take vs company size and salary.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, decide on which data is of interest to you and you are good to go.

### Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Data
Full data (and code) can be accessed within the repository. The data in the notebook is slightly modified to tackle with missing information. The data comes from the Kaggle survey data [2018](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2018/) and [2019](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019). 

## Project Motivation

For this exercise I was interested to see what data is available for understanding if there are any trends in Data Science by comparing 2018 and 2019 data from different perspectives.
The short analysis present in this repo is far from complete but it can hopefully serve as a good start in having some insights in new DS (and not only) trends. 

## File Descriptions

There is a single file (a Jupyter Notebook) that contains the code used to analyze the data.

## Results 

The results of the code are presented inline as plots. 
A brief discussion on the results can be found [here](https://medium.com/@mlacra/data-science-insights-2019-60e916d7e120?sk=370fcb0edf2fbb69b01b1f16ae31c89a).
