    "<li>Being 30-49 years old is often considered as being senior in a field, thus, one would expect that most respondents fall into the categories with 5 or more years of experience. However, if we look at all the age batches within 30-49 years, one can see that most respondents may fall within the expected categories, however, more than half of the repsondents per age range are with 5 or less years of experience, which would suggest a career shift. Moreover, looking at the range 45-49 years, we can see that most respodents are with 3-5 years of coding experience, suggesting a career shift towards Data Science as at this age one would expect 10+ years of experience on a narural career evolution.</li>\n",
    "<li>Being 50+ years old is often considered as being at a very mature point in ones career, thus, almost all respondents fall into the category  \"20+ years\" of coding experience. Nevertheless, even in these age ranges one can see that the next  most often answer is \"1-2 years\" meaning that there are people that considered starting a career in Data Science even after more than 20 years of experience in another field. That's quite a motivation! </li>\n",

Moreover, looking at the range 50-54 years, we can see that most respodents are with 3-5 years of coding experience, suggesting a career shift towards Data Science as at this age one would expect 10+ years of experience on a continuous career evolution in the same doamin.</li>\n",

    "Also, in 2019, the percentage of respondents with a Bachelor's or a Professional degree that have taken 1 course have exceeded that of those that haven't taken online courses, while in 2018 the percentage of respondents with the same degrees and no online course were with approximately 50% more than those with one course (which was the second most frequent answer after \"no courses taken\"). Furthermore, it can be said that although for all other dregrees the ratios of respondents with no online courses still exceed the other percentages, the gap between the \"no courses\" percent and the next most frequent answer (usually 1 online course) is much smaller in 2019 than in 2018 meaning that more people have taken taking online courses in 2019 than in 2018 (at least from the pool of survey respondents)."
